After studying at university I began my career in as a Software Developer in a small company, which has quintupled in size since joining. My initial focus was on native Android applications, which then progressed to Rails servers providing versioned APIs to deliver content to mobile clients.

I have worked on mobile and web applications to complete end-to-end systems. From project inception through planning and development, with adaptable deployment and delivery strategies to suit client requirements. I have worked closely with the iOS and design teams in order to understand, educate and overcome platform differences. Applications and servers I have developed are now in use by thousands of users daily.

I am an enthusiastic and capable software developer, with an eye for detail, who is also more than able to determine the architecture of a solution.

I have a wide range of experience in producing client-server Ruby on Rails servers (and APIs), along with expertise in native Android development. I also mentor colleagues on these platforms and help facilitate handovers.

I am confident in my ability to work as part of a team, both remotely and within an office.
