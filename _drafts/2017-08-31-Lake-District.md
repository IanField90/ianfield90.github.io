After 5 months without a break from work my parents offered me a room in a cottage they'd booked in the Lake District several months before leaving. Initially I was a little apprehensive, unsure what a holiday with parents would be like this far on from flying the nest. But partly through convenience, and the beautiful location I went ahead. During the weeks leading up to the holiday I had no expectations or plans for things to do. My past experiences of the Lakes involving temperamental weather to say the least. By the time it came to stepping out of the office and onto yet another delayed and busy train I was really looking forward to a total escape.

In classic last minute packing I filled my Brother's hand-me-down duffle bag with clothes for all eventualities. Far be it from me to determine whether or not I'd need shorts and flip-flops or full waterproofs. The weather up there is a little delayed as the seasons move at walking pace northwards. I woke up in good time for the early pick-up to avoid the traffic. My parents, having always struggled with navigating in the car to where I live, hadn't quite managed to pull up on my road, but rather at the end. A short walk later I was in the car feeling rather fresh with the early morning chill.

We made good time travelling up to the first stop at Warrick service. I was definitely ready for some breakfast by then. Sadly, as with any roadside cafe, the full-english must have been sitting on the hot plate for quite a while. My parents were trying to keep an eye out for the red kites along the way. Reading being relatively plagued with them it wasn't something I really wanted to keep an eye on. I was quite content with gazing out across the chilterns.

It was another decent stint of motorway driving by my dad before we wound up at Lancaster services for another break. But after 406 miles from my parents house we'd made it to Stainton in the north-east of the national park. As we got out the car to scope out the cottage a Black Labrador had happily plonked down and was eagerly watching us while her walker was trying to jivvy her along. Apparently she had a tendency to assume any car had her owners in while she was with her 'grandmother'. Despite the sun there wasn't a lot of heat compared to the unseasonably warm weather I'd been having back in Reading.

Although we were a little earlier than the check-in time the cottage was ready for us. After entering a code on the outdoor coded key box - much like ones I'd been used to in the escape rooms that I've done with my housemates - we were in. Thankfully although I had to duck in through the door the rest of downstairs had decent headroom for a cottage of its age. We didn't take too long to unload the car and unpack all the paraphernalia that comes with cottage rental holidays. We decided we'd have a wander around the village, naturally gravitating towards the local pub - The Kings Arms. It was good to see that Black Sheep ale was on tap, rather than the usual bottled offering you'd have to default to from Tesco back home. They also had some rhubarb gin, which I'd noted to try - but never actually got around to.

I was quite disappointed to discover that the notebook that I'd packed turned out not to be my travel notebook, but an old and filled work one. So much for escaping and capturing things in detail. So the rest is from a smattering of notes that I could be bothered to make on my phone.
