Now that I've been commuting for considerably over a year on the stretch between Reading and Central London I feel I've gathered enough stories to share.

Holidays really open your eyes to that sweet, sweet, greener grass on the other side. Months of operating to a pretty stringent schedule with _so_ much beyond my control really take its toll. UK Public transport. Going from a 30 minute walk, or 10 minute cycle to and from work to an hour and a half each way each day has taken a serious adjustment. My mental health taking the biggest hit. Sacrificing so much time leaves many baffled, and it continues to do for me.

Around half the year you're travelling home in darkness, and a quarter of it start the same way, and although I'm more of a lark than an owl this is unequivocally shit.
