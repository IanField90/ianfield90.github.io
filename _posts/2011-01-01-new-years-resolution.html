I don't know about you, but I find it difficult to remember my New Years Resolution, let alone keep it. So I think noting it down will be a good way of keeping track, reflecting and possibly spurring some of you on.<br /><br />This year I'm going to try some self improvement, at least, I'd see it as improvement. Recently I checked out my BMI on the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/Healthyweightcalculator.aspx">NHS tool</a>. I did this to stop speculating as to what my weight should be and actually find out a hard value. Although many are&nbsp;sceptical&nbsp;about the relevance of BMI to them, I think it's quite relevant to me. So my BMI turned out to be 17. A fair way outside the 'healthy weight' category of 18.5-25 to the point where my indicator was close to the edge of the scale. After playing for a bit I discovered I needed to put on a stone to tip into the 'Healthy weight' section.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TRswvn7hsjI/AAAAAAAAAKA/ry4jrVY6l-I/s1600/bmi.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="82" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TRswvn7hsjI/AAAAAAAAAKA/ry4jrVY6l-I/s320/bmi.PNG" width="320" /></a></div><br />It's not as if I don't eat, I do, just I'm not too sure it's the right stuff. I also don't think my non-exercise habit is helping. I don't want this to cost me money, so the gym is out.<br /><br />So my resolution(s) are the following:<br /><br /><ul><li>Eat better - learn to cook more inspiring foods</li><li>Blog more regularly</li><li>Study more</li><li>Go climbing</li><li>Exercise daily (3 reps)</li><ul><li>10 Push-ups (spiders if I'm feeling adventurous)</li><li>10 Sit-ups</li><li>10 Flyovers</li><li>10 Arm curls</li><li>10 Lunges</li></ul></ul><div>I'm quite keen on keeping these up throughout the year to see what effect they have. So I'll start as I mean to go on. You'll notice on here whether I'm keeping at least the blog posting one. What're your resolutions?</div>
