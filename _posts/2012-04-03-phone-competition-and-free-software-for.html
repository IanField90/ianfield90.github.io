<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Being a student studying computer science I regularly use a variety of software packages to get the job done. One of the powerful tools in the first year of university was Visual Studio. But I was aware that not many students were informed where they could download this software, the simple answer is through Dreamspark (<a href="http://www.dreamspark.com/">www.dreamspark.com</a>). This is a portal to free software for all students at participating Universities. You can grab a lot of useful tools here, in particular for a competition for a Nokia Lumia 800.<br /><br />The Windows Phone Incentive scheme this year has started. The idea is that students who are eligible dream big, and create useful and beautiful applications for the Windows Phone 7 market place with a chance to grab one of the shiny new Windows Phone 7 devices, and win a trip to the Microsoft Technology Centre here in the U.K. You can find further details at&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoftukstudents/archive/2012/03/13/new-student-incentive-write-apps-chance-to-win-a-windows-phone.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoftukstudents/archive/2012/03/13/new-student-incentive-write-apps-chance-to-win-a-windows-phone.aspx</a><br /><br />Now that the University of Reading has had it's Phone Camp event day from Microsoft and three lucky people were rewarded with a brand new Nokia Lumia 800, maybe those folks will still give creating an app a try!<br /><br /><br /></div>
