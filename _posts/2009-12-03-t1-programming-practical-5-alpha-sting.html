Note: I did not complete this in time for it to count. I did it to prove to myself that I could. I also believe that it exceeds the date range required of it.<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" mce_name="strong" mce_style="font-weight: bold;" style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis</span><br />A program should be created to calculate what day of the week a provided date between 1<span class="Apple-style-span" mce_name="sup" mce_style="vertical-align: super;" style="vertical-align: super;">st</span> January 1900 and 1<span class="Apple-style-span" mce_name="sup" mce_style="vertical-align: super;" style="vertical-align: super;">st</span> January 2010 is passed to it falls on.<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" mce_name="strong" mce_style="font-weight: bold;" style="font-weight: bold;">Design</span><br />The user should be able to enter a series of dates and be given the results for the dates they supply. It is not required for a range of dates as these would just be consecutive days and be irrelevant to the original program.<br />The user should input a date YYYY, DD, MM.<br />The new solution should be created using existing code from the original solution in order to reduce the amount of work required.<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" mce_name="strong" mce_style="font-weight: bold;" style="font-weight: bold;">Code</span><br /><a href="http://pastie.org/723768" mce_href="http://pastie.org/723768" target="_blank">Code</a><br />Syntax highlighting thanks to <a href="http://pastie.org/" mce_href="http://pastie.org" target="_blank">pastie.org</a>
