Today was a day mostly for Tom. He was happy to have a chance to go and visit the huge football stadium and pick up some souvenirs. This meant another journey on the Metro for us. However, as we weren't joining him in the stadium visit we were planning on spending some time at a caf√©. Just outside our Metro stop I spotted a local market, which we briefly went into. It was more of an everyday local market, but there was still plenty of variety on offer.

After this we went off in search of 'Green' on Google maps. We found one to be lightly lined with flowers outside a school. But all in the shade. I wanted to make the most of the sun while we were there so I 'gently' encouraged the others to sit in a spot in the sun. We had not been sat there for long before the flies had become a nuisance and we moved on again.

We had given Tom instructions on where to meet us after he was finished. We gave his Phone some much needed TLC so that he was able to download the area for offline use.
