<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So you want to make an app. You have a blog. But you don't know how to code, or don't have time. Not a problem, you just need a touch of artistic flare and some patience with a computer drawing tool and you can have your own app done in minutes!<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">How?</span><br />There's a site out there which will handle all the code for you. You provide details on the design you want the app to follow, and it will handle the rest. <a href="http://www.followmyfeed.net/">FollowMyFeed</a>. How to go about that is explained quite clearly on the site, so check it out!<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">What do I need?</span><br />Essentially you just need some pictures to get you started.<br /><br />Splash screen - 480 x 800<br />This is the screen a user will see when your app is loading on their phone.<br /><br />Tile Icon - 173 x 173<br />This is the icon that your app will use while it is pinned to the home screen.<br /><br />Icon - 62 x 62<br />This is the icon used in the apps list (swipe to the right of the live tiles).<br /><br />Icon - 200 x 200<br />This icon is used by the publishing portal, for desktop displays.<br /><br />Icon - 99 x 99<br />Again, not used in the phone but more for marketing purposes.<br /><br />Screenshot - 480 x 800<br />This should be a screenshot of the actual application running.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Preview</span><br />Now that you've made your application you can download a XAP file of it, and it will remain saved on the web interface. But how do you get that screenshot, and play with it?<br /><br />First up, you need to grab the free developer tools online available <a href="http://create.msdn.com/en-us/resources/downloads">here</a>.<br /><br />Once these have been installed you can run your app, and create others. To run it, you need to navigate to:<br />C:/Program Files/Microsoft SDKs/Windows Phone/Tools/XAP Launcher/XAP Launcher.exe<br /><br />When you run this, you can browse to your XAP file, and load it into either an emulator, or straight onto a developer unlocked phone. The emulator had a tool to take a screenshot of the device - saving any hassle with cropping, or using a snipping tool.<br /><br />Get registered with the marketplace, and publish your app!<br /><br /></div>
