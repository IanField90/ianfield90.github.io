<span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Yesterday I got my teeth into some near first-time Web Development. My previous experience was a GCSE website (using frames *shudder*) and styling my no-longer-used MySpace page (css).<br /><br />I initially doodled the idea of the layout and a brief list of content/features of the site. Tabs featured heavily in the design. So I set out to produce this using CSS and HTML. After browsing I found a few guides of how best to do it, however this wasn't quite right for me as I wanted the tabs to be within a single page, which wouldn't need a complete reload. The way to avoid this was to use PHP in order to set a styling attribute (id) to the 'active tab' with some help from Gary Mardell and Josh Homerston (Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/jhomerston">@jhomerston</a>) &nbsp;I soon managed this.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The site can be viewed <a href="http://dp005570.webs.sse.reading.ac.uk/dev/">here</a>. It may be up, down or altered at any time though! I'm hoping to develop it further after exams.<br /><br />In order to host the site I used the free SSE hosting service, which allowed me to set up an FTP connection through MS Expression Web 3.<br /><br />Upon Gary's advice I have set the goal of hand coding each element and style as I feel it gives me more experience and better control over the site.</span>
