At present I am a little behind on my lecture note reading and optional exercises that have been set in them. Will be working on this until I'm caught up again.<br />Until then my Programming Practicals will remain alpha sting-less. Hopefully they won't be on the back seat for too long.<br />Also looking for a realistic project that I can work on. Something unique and web based to get it out there. My one idea I found to already have been done by Google. But I may be able to do it after-all and locate the same type of thing in one location. Maybe even using Google's API. Lots of spare time learning required for that. I think it could be worth it in the end though.<br />Suggestions welcomed for a project!
