<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Recently I went through the pretty painless procedure of upgrading my Macbook to OSX Lion from Snow Leopard. After spending some time re-configuring it was almost back to how it was. But it was far slower than before.<br /><br />Getting used to Natural Scrolling didn't take very long, apart from when using a scrolling mouse - that certainly took some time. But now it seems second nature, and going back to windows seems a little odd sometimes.<br /><br />Sadly it erased some of my settings, which took me some time to discover, locate, and change back again. Other than that there weren't seemingly too many changes.<br /><br />The slowing seemed extreme. 3x longer boot times and far longer shutdown times than I'd had before. So I tried rebooting in Safe Mode (holding shift), which I've read does some rebuilding for speed. No joy. Next I tried repairing disk permissions using Disk Utility, the difference was fairly minimal (and quickly reverted itself again). So after nosing around on the internet I found the solution for me.<br /><br />Holding down option (alt) whilst booting allows you to select which disk to boot from, the non-default one of these provides Disk Utility again, but this time allows you to repair the disk, rather than just disk permissions. After doing this I enjoyed faster boot times than before, but still a little longer shutting down occasionally.<br /><br />Very nice user experience, with some fluff which is easier to revert to be more like Snow Leopard.</div>
