You may have read my <a href="http://ian-field.blogspot.com/2010/03/se1sa5-programming-final-project-card.html">review</a>&nbsp;for the final project for Programming (SE1SA5). This project was completed over a number of weeks.<br /><br />I decided to produce a Card Game over a Text Prediction program as I felt it would be easier and that I could incorporate classes into it more easily to gain credit.<br /><br />Project progress was monitored by student helpers and members of staff to ensure that the work was under way enough to be completed on time. I felt that it was also good to simulate a real life situation in which it would be expected to show progress throughout the project.<br /><br />I encountered a few issues whilst programming, as I did not fully understand certain function calls, along with a more specific difficulty in a vast number of instances of a class. I posted a little frustration on how I had initially attempted to implement this on Twitter. Chris Alexander (@chris_alexander) quickly provided a possible solution of 'Class Wrapping', which at first I had to ask the meaning of. This saved me a great deal of work and gave my code readability.<br /><br />The other issue I had initially was that I was seeding the random number generator each time the random function was called. This meant that I was constantly getting the same random numbers. Patrick Parslow (@PatParslow) aided me with this issue and I learnt that seeding the random number generator should only be done once per program in order to correctly generate random numbers.<br /><br />Looking back at my program I now realise it would have been more&nbsp;professional&nbsp;and user friendly if I were to prevent an 'infinite loop' (this is not quite true as it quickly causes a stack overflow and stops program execution), which occurred when a user entered anything other than an integer value when prompted for input.<br /><br /><a href="http://pastie.org/944844">Code</a><br /><br />Syntax highlighting thanks to <a href="http://pastie.org/">pastie.org</a><br /><br />I have some ideas in which to expand upon it, which I may do over the summer as I have, so far, been unable to find a part time job:<br /><br /><ul><li>&nbsp;Allow user to chose the value of an Ace</li><li>Add support for multiple players</li><li>Prevent the loop on character entry</li></ul><div>This project taught me a lot and helped me to apply the knowledge that the module has taught me. It really goes to show how diverse programming can be. Such a wide field makes me want to dabble in a number of different situations. Game development, software development, web development. During the course of the summer I hope to have tried out most of these a bit further than I have already. But first... Exams</div>
