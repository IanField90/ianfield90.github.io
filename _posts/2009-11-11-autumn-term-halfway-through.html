I have been at university for over a month now. I think during this time I have been far more motivated to learn than I was when I was back at home in college. The workload hasn't been quite the volume I had come to expect but I think that may be because the lecture cover things in great detail along with the benefit of having done Computing at A' Level. That gave me a good boost into most of the modules I have this year. The Mathematics for Computer Science Module (<a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/sse/ug/sse-ugmodules.aspx?url=http://www.info.rdg.ac.uk/module/current/SC/MA116.htm%3f" mce_href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/sse/ug/sse-ugmodules.aspx?url=http://www.info.rdg.ac.uk/module/current/SC/MA116.htm%3f">MA116</a>) seems to be picking up at quite a pace. Already having gone through most of the first year of A' Level's topics and on to some Further Maths, such as imaginary numbers.<br />I am enjoying Programming (<a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/sse/ug/sse-ugmodules.aspx?url=http://www.info.rdg.ac.uk/module/current/SC/SE1SA5.htm%3f" mce_href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/sse/ug/sse-ugmodules.aspx?url=http://www.info.rdg.ac.uk/module/current/SC/SE1SA5.htm%3f">SE1SA5</a>) even more now. It has been filling in the gaps that I had made whilst trying to learn C++ myself along with an explanation as to why they are used. It seems to be a much more practicality based course than the books I had looked at on the language. Soon Structs, Compilation units and files are coming up. Very little of which I have looked at or learnt about before so lectures should grip me more!<br />Starting to really want to have my Xbox 360 (<a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-GB/profile/profile.aspx?pp=0&amp;GamerTag=Eldernas" mce_href="http://live.xbox.com/en-GB/profile/profile.aspx?pp=0&amp;GamerTag=Eldernas">Eldernas</a>) up here. Since the release of <a href="http://www.modernwarfare2.com/" mce_href="http://www.modernwarfare2.com/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a> I noticed so many of my friends on it. I think it is for the best that I don't have it here though as I think it would prove to be more of a distraction than anything else and if the workload got heavier it may prove difficult to get the work done to a high enough standard to meet my own satisfaction.<br />I have still been wondering why the sound of my Bass (<a href="http://www.rimmersmusic.co.uk/product_info.php?PID=83" mce_href="http://www.rimmersmusic.co.uk/product_info.php?PID=83">Ibanez EDB 400</a>) is so poor. It may have been the battery explosion inside it that had some effect. At University, however, it is fairly irrelevant as I don't have an amp here; out of the two I own I only really like the sound of my <a href="http://www.bonnersmusic.co.uk/buy/Ashdown/MAG_C210t_300_EVO_II_Combo" mce_href="http://www.bonnersmusic.co.uk/buy/Ashdown/MAG_C210t_300_EVO_II_Combo">Ashdown MAG C210T 300 EvoII Combo</a>. At 35Kg and the size it is, and the power I cannot have it here with me.<br />May post a blog soon about Hall life here sometime.
