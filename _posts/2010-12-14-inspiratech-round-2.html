You may have seen my previous post about it shortly being the deadline for round 1 submission for the Imagine Cup. The results for these submissions should be out now. If you entered - check your inbox.<br /><br />I'm very pleased to say <a href="http://inspiratech.eu/">Inspiratech</a>&nbsp;have made it through to round 2!<br /><br />We'll shortly begin our task of turning concept into creation. I'll be posting updates here with our progress throughout. The submission for round 2 must be in by the 16th of February. It'll be a video of our work on RefuCate to that date. It'll be a functional solution by then providing all goes to plan.<br /><br />If you want updates via twitter why not follow our team's account @<a href="http://twitter.com/inspiratech">Inspiratech</a>?
