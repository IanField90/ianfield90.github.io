<h3>Deep Zoom</h3> <p>This piece of software enables you to create a Silverlight application which allows you to make, essentially, an extremely large image containing smaller images within it. By extremely large I mean 4 billion pixels. Pictures can be ‘hidden’ at first until you zoom into a level where you can make out that there’s another picture there. This can continue through a number of other images. Quite a cool bit of software really. At just 5mb to download it’s far from large.</p> <p>One very good example is the <a href="http://memorabilia.hardrock.com/">Hard Rock Cafe Memorabilia</a> collection.</p> <h3>Community Clips</h3> <p>If you’ve ever seen a screencast but not managed to be able to reproduce something of quite the same quality then this is for you. You could use this to have as a demo within a presentation. Eliminating technical hitches, however I much prefer the on-the-fly style at MSFFF.</p> <p>It seems a fast, easy to use, way of making a screen cast. Just a couple of clicks and you’re away. The video’s produced are small but still retain their quality. They can then be edited within Windows Live Movie Maker.</p> <p>You can check out my first use of it recording some ‘gameplay’ in the beginnings of my first XNA project with <a href="http://twitter.com/Daniel_Parker">@Daniel_Parker</a>. (sorry for poor intruding sound).</p> <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:399813f5-8c6d-45b5-b528-80e3012364be" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div id="bde01a59-9c68-40c0-9efd-fecdfad9d39f" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;"><div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53ng2Ku3Jq4" target="_new"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TBXu5V0svGI/AAAAAAAAAGo/d_fuMvwLtZA/video9ff80c830676%5B5%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="border-style: none" galleryimg="no" onload="var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('bde01a59-9c68-40c0-9efd-fecdfad9d39f'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/53ng2Ku3Jq4&amp;hl=en\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/53ng2Ku3Jq4&amp;hl=en\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;" alt=""></a></div></div></div> <h3></h3> <h3>&nbsp;</h3> <h3>Internet Explorer Accelerators</h3> <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/features/faster.aspx">This</a> is something cool. You know when you’re browsing the internet and you see an event and think that you’ll have to look up where that is on a map? Well this revolutionises that. Simply by highlighting text you’re a click away from being able to look the text up in numerous ways ranging from finding a product for sale on Ebay or even an in-window mini map of an address!</p> <p>It certainly accelerates the browsing experience. I think I’ll give it a try next time I have to research something online. If the default accelerators don’t quite have what you’re looking for its easy to add more from the Gallery.</p>
