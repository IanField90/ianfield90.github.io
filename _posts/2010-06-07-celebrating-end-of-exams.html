Well exams are over now. Noise has resumed in halls. Celebration has officially begun. Drinking, music and fire alarms (at 2am no less).<br /><br />My future&nbsp;house mates&nbsp;asked me to name them on my blog so here goes:<br />Stephanie Webber, Tom Wilson, Alex Gunyon, Alex Hepburn.<br /><br />Steph organised a meal out for a group of us at Glo in Reading; at a time when everyone had finished exams so it was a true celebration for all. It was a really hot day and we all decided it would be best to walk down. As ever a little late. But because of the heat it meant rushing to get there on time would have been foolish.<br /><br />Arriving there we were met with a nice cool restaurant, great food and of course amazing signature cocktails, which I could've done with more despite Pete giving me most of his.<br /><br />Managed to get an invite to become a VIP there too. Up to 25% off drinks/food. I wonder how soon the card will arrive.
