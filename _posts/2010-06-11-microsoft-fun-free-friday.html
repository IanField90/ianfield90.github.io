Yes there is a comma there a bit of ambiguity without it. Perhaps Free, Fun Friday would have been clearer, though I can see they wanted alliteration. It wasn’t Fun Free, in fact far from it! <a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TBNbR9IQQhI/AAAAAAAAAGU/8xQLYjFtTwo/s1600-h/IMG000132010061111025.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="IMG00013-20100611-1102" border="0" alt="IMG00013-20100611-1102" align="right" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TBK7vpZUnlI/AAAAAAAAAGY/2HPuN3WSrLk/IMG00013201006111102_thumb5.jpg?imgmax=800" width="279" height="250"></a> <br>After meeting and chatting to <a href="http://twitter.com/bennuk">@bennuk</a> I was invited to go to <a href="http://bit.ly/bIk4CI">this event</a> at Microso<a href="http://bit.ly/bIk4CI"></a>ft in Reading, along with <a href="http://twitter.com/Daniel_Parker">@Daniel_Parker</a>. We were both intrigued about the possibility of stepping foot on the Microsoft site. I would have been happy with just that, however the draw to come along was added to by the promise of food and giveaways. Being a student means both of these are a way to the heart! I didn’t even mind losing a lie in! <br>&nbsp; <br> <h3>Location</h3> <p> <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:84E294D0-71C9-4bd0-A0FE-95764E0368D9:4bb25b51-94ec-43c4-afbc-2963216acdad" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=51.46061~-0.9250832&amp;lvl=15&amp;style=h&amp;sp=aN.51.46186_-0.9254694_Building%25203_The%2520building%2520where%2520the%2520MSFFF%2520event%2520was%2520held&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;FORM=LLWR" id="map-4a2ed1e2-4f9e-42cf-b7de-a3b5c66441ff" alt="View map" title="View map"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TBLCthitZZI/AAAAAAAAAGI/Ud72Kq7h3Y4/map-129f4a708705.jpg?imgmax=800" width="320" height="240" alt="Microsoft Campus on Bing maps"></a><br><label for="map-4a2ed1e2-4f9e-42cf-b7de-a3b5c66441ff" style="font-size:.8em;">Microsoft Campus on Bing maps</label></div></p> <p>Many, and I mean many, <a href="http://bit.ly/dhkcU3">Microsoft products</a> were presented and demoed at this event (saw a quick blog update after my comment). This event was in a unique format; varying timeslots from 5 to 15 minutes were allotted to each presenter for them to deliver their presentation in. This really added entertainment to the day. Not only drawing attention, but also the addition of a horn blast to say that a presenter had run out of time certainly prompted some laughter.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>List of Demos</h3> <ul> <table style="width: 472px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="237"> <li>Bing Maps <li>Photosynth <li>Community Clips <li>Worldwide Telescope <li>Pivot <li>DeepZoom <li>Live @ edu <li>Office Web Apps <li>Windows Live Messenger <li>Bing Translate <li>Windows Live Writer (beta, using an older version for this blog post!) <li>Windows Live Photo Gallery <li>Windows Live Movie Maker <li>Maths Worksheet Generator (exactly what it says on the tin) </li></td> <td valign="top" width="233"> <li>Songsmith <li>Photostory 3 <li>Office Moodle Add-In (saving and opening to/from Moodle) <li>Autocollage <li>Kodu <li>DreamSpark <li>Digital Literacy Curriculum <li>Office Ribbon Hero <li>Mouse Mischief (hilarious audience participation) <li>Flashcards <li>Internet Explorer Accelerators <li>PPTPlex <li>XNA Game Studio <li>Partners in Learning and Innovids<br></li></td></tr></tbody></table></ul> <ul></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The presentations were all a small number of slides along with demos of the products, with a few even causing spontaneous clapping! Some of the software did things I would think only a high powered computer could do, not to mention cost money, but my computer can handle them fine too. To easily be able to embed some aspects of these onto a website or in day to day use means that you not only get a slick and easy to use product, but it can be shown off too, all for free!<br></p> <p>Naturally a presentation day wouldn’t be a presentation day if it didn’t have a few technical hitches. These were well covered for and the momentum didn’t stop while things were sorted.<br></p> <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the day. I quickly realised my misconceptions about what Microsoft’s campus was like were wrong. It was an extremely friendly and efficient atmosphere. Everything seemed to tick along nicely. Never with a dull moment.<br></p> <p>I will blog about a selection of these products soon. But some of the products aren’t quite available yet, so I will have to wait until I can get my hands on them.</p>
