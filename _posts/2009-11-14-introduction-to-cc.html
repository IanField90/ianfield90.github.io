In my Programming module we are learning the C language currently (C++ later this year).<br /><br />In this blog I hope to display the uses of each concept that we are taught as we are taught it. Hopefully updating with a new program/some code weekly, possibly displaying the output unless it becomes too large.<br /><br />At this point (28/10/09) I'm unsure as to whether or not I will be able to provide colour syntaxing into my blog.<br /><br />I am also not confining to standards at the moment. But this may change once we become aware of them or they are introduced in lectures or practicals.<br /><br />In order to practice the correct methods of programming correctly I intend to show a brief explanation of  the process of creating the program before writing the program itself. This is to develop a problem solving outlook to the program. In the future I hope that this will prove useful to my future development projects.<br /><br />In the problem solving process, however, I would, in a real situation provide pseudo code before writing actual code. At the moment as the programs I am writhing here are relatively simple and will be commented to describe how the code operates I will be omitting this.
