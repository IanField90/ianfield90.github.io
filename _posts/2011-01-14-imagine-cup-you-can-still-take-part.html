The Imagine Cup is something I'm taking part in this year. You may have seen my post stating that it was your last chance. What I failed to mention was that although this is the case for the UK&nbsp;regional entries&nbsp;in Software Design and Embedded Development, it is not the case for some other competitions, which are globally run.&nbsp;You can still enter worldwide competitions, including <a href="http://imaginecup.com/competitions/it-challenge">regular quizzes</a> for your chance to get to the Worldwide finals in New York.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TTAwS7d5ftI/AAAAAAAAAKs/IHukfQK2vH4/s1600/ic_logo3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="93" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TTAwS7d5ftI/AAAAAAAAAKs/IHukfQK2vH4/s320/ic_logo3.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><h2>So how do you do this?</h2>Head over to <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/">www.imaginecup.com</a>&nbsp;and sign up. Simple as that. In fact, there's a quiz today. Why not give it a shot? Even if you don't sign up you can see what it's about, it may even get your <i>"help solve the world's toughest problems"</i> juices flowing!<br /><br />You can see the UK's site for progression of UK teams at:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ukic10.com/">http://www.ukic10.com/</a>.<br /><br /><h2>Inspiratech</h2><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TTAx3ao-ADI/AAAAAAAAAKw/qdvDRvOKPvc/s1600/letterhead.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TTAx3ao-ADI/AAAAAAAAAKw/qdvDRvOKPvc/s200/letterhead.png" width="194" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>My team is getting ready to kick off after our Christmas and New Year break.
