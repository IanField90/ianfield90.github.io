<p>I had borrowed this game from a friend for just under a week now. I'm a little ashamed to say that I have completed the main storyline already. However the first few minutes I didn't enjoy the game. I already found a non-repeatable glitch in the game that once I jumped towards a beam in order to land on it I seemed to 'magically' hit an invisible wall right after jumping, which caused me to fall to my death and feel like I sucked for a bit. Much later in the story I found myself attempting mounted combat, which you would think they would ensure worked correctly to include it. I found myself stuck in the jumping position on the horse's back with sword drawn and ready. Then I could no longer control the movement of my character or anything. The guards just ran around like headless chickens hacking at my horse shouting 'Where is he?' 'There he is!' a lot. The only solution was a console reset. Quite frustrating as it hadn't saved in a while and I certainly didn't want it to save whilst like that.</p><p>Some of the animations I found to be a little bellow the standard I was expecting, mainly in cut scenes where a weapon was in a characters hand but seemed to move independently from it. Still far better than I would manage though!</p><p>Now onto positives. The gameplay itself is much smoother and free flowing that the previous game, a great improvement is in the climbing. It no longer feels jerky whilst climbing up the side of a building. The storyline kept me far more amused than it's predecessor too with varied missions on it's way up to the main assassination of the memory. I admit that I didn't play the game to it's full extent. I left out most optional quests as I felt that as they were repetitive in the previous game that they would be the same in this version.</p><p>The combat is much improved and more free flowing. It is now actually possible to attack rather than relying on counters, which I found rather frustrating in the first one. The action sequences of being chased really made me feel as though I had to get away. Usually though I found myself trying to escape in a way that actually looked good for a bit more of a challenge. I occasionally found myself plummeting from a roof top as a result of this, but that's half the fun!</p><p>All in all I found it to be a great game. They also seem to have left it open for a sequel, however I have a slight feeling that it would be in present day. If it is I wonder if they would keep it sword based or whether it would go in the direction of Splinter Cell.</p>
