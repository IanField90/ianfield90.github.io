I am now embarking on the production of a Social Networking application. I am starting the process using C# of which I am partially familiar with. Along the way I will no doubt come across some issues with things I have not learnt, come across or do not understand.<br />I will be learning about some C# libraries and various APIs. Neither of which I have used before.<br />So far I have managed to produce a program which will post a tweet for me using the API:<br /><a href="http://twitter.com/IanField90/status/10780681761">http://twitter.com/IanField90/status/10780681761</a><br /><br />A small achievement for me really. I found it all a little daunting at first but now feel with that timid step I may be able to succeed in the overall goal, which I will reveal once the program development is fully&nbsp;under-way.
