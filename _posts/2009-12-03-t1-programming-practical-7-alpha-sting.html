This practical's task was to use a 2 dimensional array to store currency transfers. However the alpha sting did not just set these values hard coded but allowed the user to specify the conversion rates. The Program also allowed the user to specify which currencies they were using up to a predefined amount of 4 different currencies.<br />It was a conscious decision to use the literal array indexes in the user input as it saved the amount of code and thinking whilst debugging.<br /><a href="http://pastie.org/723560" mce_href="http://pastie.org/723560" target="_blank">Code</a><br />Syntax highlighting thanks to <a href="http://pastie.org/" mce_href="http://pastie.org" target="_blank">pastie.org</a>
