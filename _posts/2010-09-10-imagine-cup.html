In recent years Microsoft has run a worldwide competition for students called <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/">Imagine Cup</a>. It's a great opportunity to turn dreams and ambitions into reality; by creating something that really can change the world.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/"><br /><img border="0" height="131" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_gdayamxeHY4/TIt65n9p_XI/AAAAAAAAAHw/mIMs7mEPI9o/s320/IC09_CorporateLogo_standard_2.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />For me the decision to take part was quick and easy to make. How often is it you are presented with such a great opportunity? I'd been thinking about taking part for a while, be it this year or in the future. It was thanks to a tweet that I took the step towards joining a team in which to work - <b>Inspiratech</b>.<br /><br />We don't have a logo as yet, but we are registered and will be starting work on the Software Design competition very shortly. This is the first project that I will take part in, which is collaborative. This year at University I will have another number of projects, which are also collaborative. So it will be a steep learning curve, but a good one.<br /><br />The team consists of Josh Homerston (<a href="http://bluishsmoke.co.uk/blog/">Blog</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jhomerston">Twitter</a>), Dan Parker (<a href="http://danparker.posterous.com/">Blog</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/Daniel_Parker">Twitter</a>) and myself. We're looking at embracing some of the latest and soon-to-be latest technologies in order to <i>imagine a world where technology helps solve the world's toughest problems.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />I find our project idea very interesting, ambitious and exciting. I really think it's awesome motivation to be helping out charities. I hope to blog my experiences of teamwork, problem solving and tips/resources that I find useful throughout.<br /><br />Can't wait to get started!
