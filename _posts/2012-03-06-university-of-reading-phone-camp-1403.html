<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The Microsoft Academic team is coming the the University of Reading for a day introducing people to the Windows Phone 7 platform. Come along and get your feet wet with some Microsofties!<br /><br />The event runs from 1pm - 6pm on Wednesday the 14/03. I'll be there. To sign up to the event check your &nbsp;University inboxes if you're a student, or email Microsoft at ukstu@microsoft.com.<br /><br />Think up some app ideas before the day and maybe on it they can become reality, and if you're a student, they could be published for free, and you can even make money from them. Learning a skill that can make money from nothing is certainly useful!<br /><br />Not at Reading? Not to worry, you can see a full list of planned Phone Camps <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoftukstudents/archive/2011/11/21/windows-phone-camps-where-and-when.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b><br />There's an opportunity to win one of 3 brand new Nokia Lumia 800s!<br /><br />Download the software in advance from Dreamspark and get set up ready for a day of development!</div>
